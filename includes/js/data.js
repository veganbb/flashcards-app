question[0]="What does \"vegan\" mean?";
answer[0]="Very simply, being vegan means that you've chosen to live your live in a way that has the least negative impact on others. Veganism is most commonly associated with the impact that we have on animals, and vegans are known for not eateating or using any animal products. Specifically, that means we don't eat meat, dairy, or eggs, and that we dont wear wool, leather, down, or silk. Additionally, we also try to avoid products that were tested on animals.<br /><br />\
			Many vegans also do their best to purchase products which didn't involve negative consiquences to other humans or the environment. This means that we try to avoid products which were produced using slave labor, or might be the direct cause of things like rainforest destruction or climate change.<br /><br /><a href='http://www.vegan.com/what/'>http://www.vegan.com/what/</a>";

question[1]="Why are you vegan?";
answer[1]="Every vegan should have an answer to this question. It may be difficult to sum up with a simple answer, when your full reasons might take an hour (or more) long monologue to explain. The reason that this might be the most important question here is for two reasons:<br />\
1) It's open ended. Meaning that it gives you the opportunity to steer the conversation in the direction you choose. If you know that the person in front of you is 400lbs. and smokes 2 packs of cigarettes per day, they probably don't care about their personal health, so don't talk about health issues. If you see someone working out at a gym, you can talk about vegan athletes (see \"I'm an athlete and I need to eat animals to train\"). If you see someone wearing a Christian cross, talk about how God doesn't want you eating animals (see \"My religion is my moral guide, and it grants me the right to eat meat\"). <br />\
2) When a person asks this question, it means that they're showing interest. Most other questions and topics covered here are ways that meat eaters are trying to defend their way of life, and attack yours. This question shows a genuine curiosity in the lifestyle. It's important to not get frustrated, fed up, or aggressive with this question. For you it might be the 1,000th time you're answering it, but the inquirerer may have never met a vegan before and is interested in learning more.<br /><br />\
Here are some possible responses that you might want to provide. Again, remember that this should be personal to you, and targeted towards the person you're conversing with, the following are just some suggestions to help get you started:<br />\
1) Because it's the right thing to do. It helps the animals, it helps the environment, and it helps us.<br />\
2) I don't want to have animal abuse as part of my lifestyle in a society where it's still considered normal\
3) We all say that we love animals and we are against animal cruelty, but we all pay people to mutilate, torture and slaughter animals. It’s not for any necessity, it’s not because we need it for our health or survival aspect, but because of  commodity, culture and lack of education and lastly, because of taste. – James Aspey<br /><br />\

question[2]="Where do you get your protein?";
answer[2]="Anywhere and everywhere. Humans need for about 6% of their diet to be comprised of protein, though most doctors recommend 9% just to be sure. Most nuts and many vegetables contain enough protein to meet this nutritional requirement, so plant-based diets provide more than adequate protein for human health. Chicken is 25% protein, as are beans also 25%, both are way more than we need. Animals are not magical creatures that just generate protein, they get it from the plants that they eat. Ask your doctor how many patients he/she has ever treated who had a protein deficiency. Then ask how many patients he/she has had with high cholesterol. Chances are, it's zero protein deficient patients and an uncountable number of high cholesterol patients, cholesterol is only found in animal products";
category[2]="health";

question[3]="Where do you get your Omega-3's?";
answer[3]="Flax seeds, walnuts, soy beans, brussels sprouts, cauliflower. Flax seeds and walnuts have more omega-3's per serving than any fish.<br /><br /><a href='http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?dbid=84&tname=nutrient'>http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?dbid=84&tname=nutrient</a>";

question[4]="I like the taste too much to give up meat / dairy";
answer[4]="1) ...and to a rapist, rape feels good. In both of these situations there is an unwilling participant and a perpetrator looking to satisfy themselves. Civilized people require more than pleasure to justify their actions.<br />\
			2) Really? So if I put a cow on your dinner table, you would rip into it with your claws and sharp teeth? Or would you prefer it to be killed first, then processed into a hamburger patty, cooked, put between two pieces of bread, with pickle, onion, ketchup, tomato (vegetables) to make it taste right.";
category[4]="ethics";

question[5]="We're naturally meat eaters";
answer[5]="Actually we resemble herbivores in every way, and in no way resemble carnivores or omnivores.<br />\
			1) We have no carnivorous instincts. If I put a live cow in front of you, you would have zero ambition to chase it down and sink your claws into it.<br />\
			2) We don't have claws like all carnivores and omnivores have.<br />\
			3) Our intestines are 10 times the length of our torsos, the same proportion as every other herbivore on the planet. All carnivores have much shorter intestines, at about 5 times the length of their torso (source coming soon)<br />\
			4) Our canines are meaningless, and aren't an indicator, hippos have the largest caniness on the planet, and they're 100% herbivorous <sup><a href='https://www.reference.com/science/animal-biggest-teeth-77a1154579c33f1d'>1</a></sup>, <sup><a href='http://animals.mom.me/hippos-eat-2933.html'>2</a></sup<<br />\
			5) Our jaws go side to side in a grinding motion, to grind leaves. All carnivores have jaws that only open and close (source coming soon)<br /><br />\

question[6]="They're just animals, they're here for us to use";
answer[6]="When we apply this logic to ANY other group, we realize how absurd this argument truly is....'They're just women, they're here for us to use,' 'they're just black people, they're here for us to use,' 'they're just mentally ill, they're here for us to use.' The moment we lose compassion for beings who clearly suffer, we lose our humanity. In the USA we used that logic to keep black people as slaves for hundreds of years, and now we realize that that's not right.";
category[6]="ethics";

question[7]="I just don't think you can be healthy without meat and dairy";
answer[7]="Ask the person \"What exactly do you mean by 'healthy'?\" - Once they're specific reference that specific question. If they won't get specific, then you can respond with \"Anything that you find in meat was absorbed by that animal from when she ate plants, then most of those plant nutrients were absorbed by the animal, you're just eating what's left that wasn't already absorbed and used. They're not magical creatures that just create protein, everything they have was gotten from the ground\"";
category[7]="health";

question[8]="It's my personal choice";
answer[8]="I don't care about what you do to yourself, I'm not the health police, you can go jump off a bridge and kill yourself for all I care, but you're harming others, and oppressing their rights to live and be free. Your personal choice ends where someone else's nose begins.";

question[9]="I'm an athlete and I need to eat animals to train";
answer[9]="1) In the 2016 Rio Olympics, the ONLY weight lifter that the USA sent is a vegan - Kendrick Farris<br />\

answer[10]="In what way can: rape, murder, torture, and enslavement be moral?";
category[10]="ethics";

question[11]="It's just my cultural tradition, get over it!";
answer[11]="In some cultural traditions it's perfectly acceptable to control women, use rape as a form of punishment, eat dogs and cats, throw virgins into volcanoes, be openly racist/ homophobic, use slave labor, put your enemy's head on a stake in your front yard... While consuming animals may be culturally acceptable, tradition does not dictate morality.";
category[11]="ethics";

question[12]="I only buy free range, grass fed, ethically produced meat/ dairy/ eggs";
answer[12]="It's all the same. \"Free Range\" just means that instead of putting 5 chickens in a cage the size of a milk crate, they put thousands in a single room. The \"Organic\" label only has to do with our own health, it means that the cow wasn't given antibiotics and when they get sick from the horrendous conditions they're placed in, they aren't allowed to get antibiotics as medicine <img src='includes/images/questions/12.jpg' style='width:100%' />";
category[12]="ethics";

question[13]="What about plants, they're alive too!";
answer[13]="Unlike animals, plants don't have a central nervous system. If you put your hand over a flame, it would feel hot, and you would pull your hand back, the same is true for any animal, whether it be a dog, cat, cow, pig, chicken, monkey, ect. Also, you already know that harvesting plants and slaughtering animals aren't the same, because you would consider taking a kid apple picking, but wouldn't bring them to a slaughterhouse.";
category[13]="ethics";

question[14]="We need to eat animals to survive";
answer[14]="Most of us live in a modern society. We don't forage for food on a daily basis, we go to a store and purchase the items we need. There, you can just as easily buy plant based food items as you can animal based products. We're not fighting for survival here, we live in a world of abundance. With so many plant-based options, there is no need to kill an animal for food. ";
category[14]="health";

question[15]="Lions eat animals, why can't I";
answer[15]="Well I noticed that you're wearing clothes, and that when you greeted me you didn't sniff my butt. I also notice that you didn't mark your territory by peeing everywhere, and that you have a cell phone. You can't pick one trait from a specific species and use that as your justification for murder. Additionally lions are actually carnivores unline us (see \"We're natrually meat eaters\"), and they need to eat other animals for survival (see \"We need to eat animals to survive\").<br /><br />\
Also, carnivores only make up about 5% of all mammals. So you're choosing a single trait from a very small minority population to justify your actions for other reasons, let's dig a little bit deeper and try to uncover why you really eat animals. <br />(5% claim comes from dividing the number of carnivores from the total number of mamals)<br /><sup><a href='https://www.britannica.com/animal/carnivore-mammal'>1</a></sup>,<sup><a href='http://www.factmonster.com/ipka/A0934288.html'>2</a>";

question[16]="After they have had a fulfilled life it's is not bad to put them to another use?";
answer[16]="I can go with you on that, if an animal lived a life free from rape, torture and abuse, and died of natural causes, either old age or disease or as road kill, and you come across it and think \"I'm hungry, I'm going to eat that\", by all means, go for it. The issue however it twofold. First off, zero animals that are ever served in a supermarket lived out their lives, they were slaughtered as soon as their usefulness on the farm has expired (cows stop giving milk or chickens stop laying eggs). Second off, since we're herbivores, I know that if you came across road-kill, you wouldn't be considering eating it, because that's extremely weird. If you're calling veganism extreme, but you're considering eating road kill, then you really need to take a step back to analyze things. As a side note though, if you've ever had a dog or cat who died, what did you do with it's body? Did you eat it or bury it? So here, for the first time in your life you actually had the opportunity to eat a non-abused animal and you let that go, why?";
category[16]="health";

question[17]="Where do you get your B12?";
answer[17]="While it is true that B12 is not produced by plants, it is also not produced by animals. Rather, B12 is the byproduct of a specific bacterial fermentation that thrives in soil, some fermented plant matter, dead flesh and the guts of animals. Fortunately, this bacteria is easily mass-produced for human consumption now, and many foods are fortified with it, so there is no need to eat animals in order to receive sufficient B12.<br /><br />\
			Two quotes from Dr. John McDougall<br />\
			\"Take a moment to compare the possible consequences of your dietary decisions. You could choose to eat lots of B12-rich animal foods and avoid the one-in-a-million chance of developing a reversible anemia and/or even less common, damage to your nervous system.  However, this decision puts you at a one-in-two chance of dying prematurely from a heart attack or stroke; a one-in-seven chance of breast cancer or a one-in-six chance of prostate cancer.  The same thinking results in obesity, diabetes, osteoporosis, constipation, indigestion, and arthritis.\"<br /><br />\
			\"On average, for someone raised on the Western diet, about 2 to 5 milligrams of B12 are stored, mostly in the liver.  This means most people have at least a three year reserve of this vital nutrient.  Conservation of B12 by the body boosts the time this supply lasts by 10-fold.  After excretion through the bile into the intestines most of the B12 is reabsorbed by the ileum for future use.  As a result of this recirculation it actually takes, on average, 20 to 30 years to become deficient after becoming a strict vegan.  That is if no vitamin B12 were consumed—which is impossible, even on a strict vegan diet, because of bacterial sources of B12 from the person’s bowel, contaminated vegetable foods, and the environment.\"";

question[18]="The vegan diet is a new fad that will come and go like all the rest";
answer[18]="Veganism is a philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude - as far as is possible and practicable - all forms of animal exploitation and cruelty for any reason, including medicine, food, clothing, entertainment or for any other purpose. In dietary terms it denotes the practice of dispensing with all products derived wholly or partly from animals. In short, veganism is a philosophical position and not a diet.";
category[18]="health";

question[19]="Raising vegan children is a form of brainwashing because children are too young to make a meaningful choice in the matter. Children have a right to eat meat, so forcing a vegan lifestyle on them is unethical";
answer[19]="Parents are responsible for the physical well-being of their children, and they are also responsible for providing ethical guidance. Evidence shows that a plant-based diet is healthy for people of all life stages, including children, so vegan parents are following appropriate nutritional guidelines. Veganism is the philosophical position that using animals for human benefit is unethical, so vegan parents are simply teaching their children compassion through veganism, much as any parent might teach a child to be kind";
category[19]="health";

question[20]="People will not become vegan because plant-based diets are boring, bland and unappetizing";
answer[20]="It's actually meat that is boring, bland, and unappetizing. If I put a live cow in front of you, you would have zero desire to sink your teeth in, but if I put an apple, banana, ect. in front of you, you would at the very least consider it. Even if that cow had been slaughtered, and processed into a hamburger patty and cooked, you would still want it flavored with two pieces of bread, a pickle, onion, ketchup, and tomato (vegetables) to make it taste right. Many common foods are already vegan; bread, pasta, rice, fruit, vegetables and so on. All of these foods can be prepared in several ways, and other foods can be made vegan with simple ingredient substitutions. Beyond that, many cultures have long traditions of flavorful plant-based cooking, and these offer the opportunity for vegans to expand their culinary palates. Additionally, "

question[21]="Making wool is a normal and natural activity for sheep that they don't suffer or die from, so using wool isn't an ethical issue.";
answer[21]="Essentially all wool comes from sheep sheared on industrial farms, which often involves very rough handing of the sheep and is a process which inflicts painful nicks and cuts on the sheep's skin. These injuries attract flies and promote \"flystrike\", especially around their tail where the skin bunches up. To combat this, so two strips of wool-bearing skin from around either side of the sheep's buttocks are removed, without using anesthetics, in order to create a scarred area of flesh that's less susceptible to infestations. This process is call \"mulesing\". It is also important to remember that there are no \"old-animals\" homes for animals that are no longer profitable to industry, and sheep are no exception. When they age and no longer produce as much wool they are shipped to the slaughter house, and this happens long before their natural lifespan. It's clear that sheep are very much hurt by all of this";

question[23]="My religion is my moral guide, and it grants me the right to eat meat";
answer[23]="This depends on the religion, but the majority of people believe in a world that began with Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. In this story, the very first thing that God ever says to Adam (in Genesis 1:29) is \"I give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food\" It's only later on, after humans are exiled from the garden of eden that we begin to eat meat. Later on, when God gives the 10 commandments, we are told \"Thou shalt not kill\", there is no asterisk next to that which specifies that it only applies to humans. We are not to kill any being.<br /><br /><a href='https://www.facebook.com/notes/%D7%96%D7%99%D7%9E%D7%9F-%D7%9E%D7%A8%D7%A7%D7%95%D7%A1/the-bible-jesus-and-veganism-by-gary-yourofsky/413750182000123/'>There are numerous verses that point to many characters of the bible being vegan</a>"

question[31]="I need to get calcium from milk";
answer[31]="If I said to you \"Cigarettes, they do a body good\", what would you think about me? You would probably think that I work for a cigarette company, so why is it that we believe the dairy industry when they make that claim. In the US we put cow lactations on everything, and yet we're number 1 in the world for incidences of osteoperosis. This is no coinsedence, and in fact, multiple studies have found that with higher intake of dairy, comes higher incedence of osteoperosis. This is due to the acidic animal protein found in milk which causes your body to leach calcium out of your bones to nuturalize your stomach's PH. Green vegetables (like kale, broccoli, and spinach) have about the same amount of calcium, but don't come with the negative affects acidic animal protein. <sup><a href='http://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/11-countries-with-the-highest-rates-of-osteoporosis-in-the-world-359037/11/'>1</a></sup>, <sup><a href='http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jbmr.279/full'>2</a></sup>, <sup><a href='http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00198-004-1755-6'>3</a></sup>, <sup><a href='http://www.vegsource.com/news/2010/12/new-study-increased-milk-intake-does-not-protect-against-osteoporosis-but-does-promote-ovarian-and-p.html'>4</a></sup>, <sup><a href='http://www.notmilk.com/calbones.txt'>5</a></sup>.
